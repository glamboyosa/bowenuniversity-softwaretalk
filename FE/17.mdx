# JavaScript client-side Frameworks

Once you've "mastered" JavaScript (ES5 & Next-Gen) you'll want to pick up
a framework.

# Why frameworks ?

- Frameworks make development of complex applications easier and faster.
- Traversing the DOM is expensive
- You'll likely be required to use one in a job
  Think Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, AirBnB

# What frameworks ?

We have 3 major frameworks namely:

- React.js developed and maintained by Facebook
- Vue created by Evan You and maintained by an open source team
- Angular developed and maintained by Google
